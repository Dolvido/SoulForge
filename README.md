Retrieval Mechanism: Implements efficient retrieval algorithms to access stored memories based on various retrieval cues (e.g., semantic, episodic).
Memory Consolidation: Facilitates the process of memory consolidation, strengthening connections between related memories and integrating them into the individual's cognitive framework.
3. Personality Module:
Trait Spectrum: Models personality traits along multiple dimensions, drawing from established personality theories (e.g., Big Five, Myers-Briggs).
Assessment Methods: Incorporates assessment tools such as questionnaires, behavioral observations, and self-report inventories to profile personality characteristics.
Trait Dynamics: Accounts for the dynamic nature of personality, capturing fluctuations and adaptations in response to internal and external influences.
Predictive Modeling: Leverages personality data to predict behavioral tendencies, interpersonal dynamics, and response patterns in various situations.
4. Belief Module:
Belief System Representation: Tracks individual beliefs, values, and worldview, recognizing the multifaceted nature of belief systems (e.g., religious, philosophical, cultural).
Evidential Support: Evaluates the strength of beliefs based on factors such as personal experiences, cultural influences, and rational arguments.
Belief Formation: Explores the processes underlying belief formation and modification, including socialization, cognitive biases, and existential reflections.
Conflict Resolution: Addresses conflicts and inconsistencies within belief systems, facilitating cognitive dissonance resolution and belief integration.
5. Consciousness Module:
